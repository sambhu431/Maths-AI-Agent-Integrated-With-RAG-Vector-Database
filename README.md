<h2> Maths AI Agent Integrated With RAG Vector Database </h2>

## Project Overview
The Maths AI Agent is an intelligent system designed to assist users in solving mathematical problems efficiently by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a vector-based knowledge database. This AI agent ensures accurate and context-aware responses by dynamically retrieving relevant information from structured data sources.

* **Advanced Mathematical Problem Solving:** Handles algebra, calculus, geometry, and numerical computations. 

* **Vector Database Search:** Retrieves mathematical concepts, examples, and formulas for enhanced accuracy.

* **AI-Driven Theorem & Proof Generation:** Supports automated theorem validation and step-by-step reasoning. 

* **Contextual Query Understanding:** Uses AI to refine queries for better search results and precise computations. 

* **Error Detection & Debugging:** Identifies calculation mistakes and provides corrective insights.

* **Interactive Query Resolution** Engages users with AI-driven explanations and tutoring-style responses.

## Key Features:

**Advanced Mathematical Computation:**
* Solves equations across algebra, calculus, trigonometry, statistics, and more.

**RAG-Based Knowledge Retrieval:**
* Searches a vector database for mathematical references, definitions, and proofs.

**AI-Driven Query Optimization:**
* Generates search-engine-friendly queries for retrieving precise mathematical content.

**Contextual Answer Refinement:**
* Ensures responses are structured, detailed, and aligned with user queries.

**Web Scraping & Data Extraction:**
* Uses Selenium headless drivers for real-time query resolution.

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
1. LangChain
2. Ollama LLM
3. FAISS Vector Store
4. HuggingFace Embeddings
5. RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
6. PromptTemplate
7. Selenium WebDriver
8. Extracting Web Data (UnstructuredURLLoader)
9. LLM Chains & Function Invocation
10. SystemMessage for AI role definition

<br>

## Workflow:
* User submits a math-related query.
* Vector database (FAISS) is searched for relevant concepts and solutions.
* If a valid answer exists, it is returned to the user.
* If no answer is found, the AI Agent dynamically generates a response using web scraping, search techniques, and structured queries.
* Extracted information is refined and presented in a user-friendly, mathematically accurate format.
